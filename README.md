# Battle #
-This is a simple, two-player game. Each player chooses their username on the homepage, then is redirected to the battle (play) page. Each player starts with 100 hitpoints. When a player is attacked, their hitpoints decrease by 10. Player 1 has the first turn and is able to click a button to attack Player 2. Then it is Player 2's turn to attack Player 1. The first player to reach 0 hitpoints loses. The page then displays the name of the player who has lost.
-Future features: Player 1 and Player 2 are still able to attack each other even if someone has already lost. In the future we'd like to prevent the ability for the attacks to occur once a player's hitpoints score has reached 0.
